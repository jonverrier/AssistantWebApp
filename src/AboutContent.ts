`CrossFit works. Functional fitness works. Coached classes, varied movement, strength and conditioning, and a real sense of community — it works. And right now, there’s never been a greater need for what small, independent gym owners deliver: real results, grounded in real relationships. But let’s be honest — it’s a zoo out there. Influencers, workout apps, and big-box gyms are shouting the loudest, often selling quick fixes that turn out to be mirages. Meanwhile, they’re driving down prices and making it harder for the real thing to stand out.
That’s where Strong AI Technologies comes in. We help small gym owners compete — and thrive — by giving them the power of cutting-edge, AI-enabled tools that support their members beyond the gym floor. From answering FAQs and streamlining onboarding to offering nutrition support, accessory work, and personalised guidance for more experienced members, our AI solutions will extend your care, your knowledge, and your values into every part of a member’s journey. The more members interact, the smarter the system gets — offering tailored advice imbued with the spirit and values of your gym. We’re here to help you scale your impact, not your screen time — and keep the heart of your gym exactly where it belongs: in your community.
Be one of the first gyms in London with your own AI assistant.
